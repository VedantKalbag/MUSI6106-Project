# SPRINT PLANNING:

## Sprint 1:
For the beginning of our development, we will have 3 people (Mir, Shan, and Jocelyn) on ML backend (PyTorch conversions) and 2 people (Thiago and Vedant) creating the JUCE plugin, with a basic framework to process audio. 

## Future plans:
If we cannot get the PyTorch conversion working after 2 sprints (4 weeks), we will pivot the back end of the project to focus on creating a plugin host - a VST that can host other VSTs (or built in effects), creating a signal chain VST useful for guitar amp simulators. This would be built on the JUCE front end that had been created so far.
